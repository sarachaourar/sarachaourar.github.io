      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project was developed as part of the <em>Advanced Remote Sensing</em> course (WS25). 
        The objective was to compare two image segmentation strategies applied to a multispectral 
        satellite image: the <strong>Mean Shift</strong> algorithm implemented in ArcGIS Pro and 
        <strong>Multiresolution Segmentation (MRS)</strong> executed in eCognition.

      <h2>Data & Study Area</h2>
      <p>
        The input dataset is a pansharpened SPOT satellite image from 2005, projected in UTM Zone 33. 
        It contains Near-Infrared (NIR), Red, Green, and Mid-Infrared (MIR) bands. The study area was 
        selected to analyze agricultural fields and vegetation patterns, with a focus on how 
        different segmentation approaches handle parcel boundaries.

      <h2>Segmentation Methods</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Multiresolution Segmentation (MRS)</strong> groups neighboring pixels based on both 
        spectral and spatial criteria such as shape, smoothness, and compactness. The scale parameter 
        controls object heterogeneity and allows the creation of hierarchical object levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast, the <strong>Mean Shift</strong> algorithm relies solely on spectral similarity, 
        clustering pixels based on color and brightness without considering object geometry.
      </p>

      <h2>Main Result</h2>
      <p>
        The figure below shows the segmentation result generated in <strong>eCognition</strong> using 
        multiresolution segmentation. The output clearly delineates agricultural parcels and produces 
        polygon-like objects, making it well suited for object-based analysis and future machine 
        learning applications.

      <h2>Key Findings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Mean Shift segmentation tends to merge spectrally similar but spatially distinct fields.</li>
        <li>Multiresolution Segmentation preserves object shapes and parcel boundaries.</li>
        <li>eCognition outputs are more practical for object-based classification workflows.</li>
        <li>The results show strong potential for creating training data for AI models.</li>
      </ul>
