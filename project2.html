      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project was completed as part of the <em>Digital Earth: Big Earth Data Concepts</em> course (WS25). 
        The aim was to explore the Copernicus Data Space Browser by applying a rule-based land cover 
        classification to Sentinel-2 imagery using spectral indices.

      <h2>Data & Study Area</h2>
      <p>
        The analysis uses a Sentinel-2 image of Salzburg acquired on the 13th of November 2025.

      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        A classification script adapted from 
        <a href="https://custom-scripts.sentinel-hub.com/custom-scripts/sentinel-2/urban_classified/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        Šebela (2020)</a>
         was used to distinguish between 
        <strong>water</strong>, <strong>built-up areas</strong>, <strong>vegetation</strong>, and 
        <strong>barren soil</strong>. The classification relies on a combination of spectral indices 
        and threshold-based decision rules.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>NDVI:</strong> (B8 − B4) / (B8 + B4)</li>
        <li><strong>NDWI:</strong> (B3 − B8) / (B3 + B8)</li>
        <li><strong>BSI:</strong> 2.5 × ((B11 + B4) − (B8 + B2)) / ((B11 + B4) + (B8 + B2))</li>
        <li><strong>SWIR:</strong> Sentinel-2 Band 11</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Classification Logic</h2>
      <div class="result-box">
        <ul>
          <li>Pixels with <strong>NDWI &gt; 0.2</strong> are classified as <strong>water</strong>.</li>
          <li>Pixels with <strong>NDVI &lt; 0.1</strong> and <strong>high SWIR</strong> values are classified as <strong>built-up</strong>.</li>
          <li>Pixels with <strong>NDVI &gt; 0.2</strong> are classified as <strong>vegetation</strong>.</li>
          <li>Remaining pixels are classified as <strong>barren soil</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Results & Discussion</h2>
      <p>
        The script performs well in separating barren soil from built-up areas, particularly in 
        clearly defined urban and rural regions. However, as noted by Šebela, classification accuracy 
        decreases in suburban areas where vegetation and housing are tightly mixed.
