# 👋 Hi, I'm Sara Chaourar

An aspiring Earth Observation & AI engineer, passionate about digital environmental solutions.  
Currently pursuing the Copernicus Master in Digital Earth 🌍  
Let’s build a smarter, cleaner world together.

## 💫 About Me

I'm a multidisciplinary environmental science graduate with a passion for applying AI to Earth Observation.  
Currently based between Austria and France as part of the Copernicus Master in Digital Earth, I'm blending my marine background with cutting-edge geospatial tools.

🌊 I trained a custom AI to detect beach crowding from satellite images.  
🛰️ I analyze remote sensing data using tools like QGIS, SNAP, and Python.  
🌍 I want to help build climate-resilient cities and coastal communities.

## 🚀 Selected Projects

### 🛰️ BeachCrowd.AI — Satellite-based Vehicle Detection
A Yolov8-powered AI that analyzes satellite images to estimate beach crowding by detecting parked vehicles.
- 🛠️ Tools: Python, Ultralytics YOLOv8, ArcGIS, Label Studio
- 📊 Outcome: 91% mAP, robust performance on real-world beach images

### ♻️ Waste Management Study in Coastal Algeria
Field-based research assessing pollution, public awareness, and policy in a coastal town.
- 🔍 Methods: Field surveys, GIS analysis, statistical evaluation
- 🗂️ Output: 50-page report with actionable recommendations
